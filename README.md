# Convertor
Convertor is a python script wrote for 3.x versions. It uses a module named [ffmpeg-python](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python) to encode an audio file to another audio output file (Ex : mp3 -> wav).

The script has to be in the same folder than musics you have to convert.

Example of command :
```bash
python3 convertor.py mp3 wav # --debug (optional)
```
